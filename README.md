## üß≠ Routes

Many of the paths you're used to may now be blocked:

- Rockfalls
- Missing rope climbs
- Natural hazards

Expect longer, tougher journeys to key locations:

- **Timberwolf Mountain** ‚Äì The Summit  
- **Ash Canyon** ‚Äì The Gold Mine  
- **Blackrock** ‚Äì The Prison

But don‚Äôt worry, each region still has a **clear path forward**. Paths are either:

- Obvious, or  
- Marked with subtle environmental hints

Once you travel these main routes, **shortcuts will become available**:

- Some open automatically after progress
- Others can be unlocked by the player (e.g. deploying ropes)

So while the first trip may be long, repeat journeys will be quicker.

## üèû Inaccessible Areas

Ash Canyon and Blackrock contain newly opened spaces that were previously unreachable.

Some are scenic. Some are useful. Some are both.

Keep an eye out for:

- The **scenic overlook** in Ash Canyon  
- It‚Äôs safe if you're careful‚Äîno guard rails!  
- Best visited on a clear day for a breathtaking view

## üó∫Ô∏è Relocated Containers & Prepper Caches

- Cargo containers have been **moved** and are **no longer out in the open**
- No help from the map
- You'll need to **thoroughly explore Timberwolf Mountain** to find them all
- Prepper caches in all three regions are now in **harder-to-find locations**

---

## üê∫ Wildlife Spawns

Wildlife spawns have been moved:

- Some of the wolves, timberwolves, moose, and deer now appear in new places
- Some may interfere with routes, but most are placed for **challenge and variety**
- Once you learn their new patterns, they can be avoided like normal

---

## üéÆ Player Spawns

Each region has one **challenging new player spawn location**.
