### Details
What does this text look like? 


Along with these options, you can find a path that leads to and from the premiere overlook in Ash Canyon that is not normally accessible.  Be sure to watch your step!

## Notes
- There is no need to employ any advanced techniques or exploits (such as mountain goating) to traverse the more difficult routes.  You also do not need to have any other mods installed, such as the Jump mod.
- I recommend using this mod on new games, but it is compatible with existing saves.  If you switch back and forth between saves that use Ruthless Heights options and saves that do not, all changes will be reverted when switching the options, with the exception that any wildlife that spawned due to the Ruthless Heights wildlife setting being enabled will still be there (but no more will spawn).
- Player spawn locations in all three regions have been changed each having a varying degree of difficulty.  (Timberwolf Mountain - Easy), (Ash Canyon - Difficult), (Blackrock - Ruthless)
