### • Routes
As you move around the regions you will find that many of the routes you are accustomed to using now have impassable points for one reason or another.  There may be a rock blocking the way or an undeployed rope climb that is normally deployed that will prevent you from continuing on a particular route.  When you are traveling a primary route to the major point of interest in a region (The Summit - The Gold Mine - The Prison), you should expect the journey will be much longer and more difficult than what you are used to.  While the game envirnoment has been altered in many ways, all viable paths forward will be obvious.  In other words, you will not need to search for hidden or very narrow paths to make your way forward.  If it isn't completely obvious, then there will be subtle hints to point you in the right direction that are in keeping with what you already find in The Long Dark.

Along with the clear obstacles as mentioned above, there are a variety of other changes that have been made to the environment to help create a fresh experience.  Expect the unexpected.  And while many of the changes that have been made are ment to make these regions more challenging, they are not meant to be frustratingly difficult.  On the contrary, you may find that after you get to know the alternate version of these regions that they are quite hospitable.  All of the primary routes have shortcuts built in that can either be enabled by the player (ex. rope climb deployed) or the shortcuts will open up on their own after something in particular has occurred.  So, you will have to travel these very long routes only once.  After the first time, you can make use of the shortcuts.

### • Inaccesible Areas
Ash Canyon and Blackrock both have fairly substantially sized areas that were never made accesible to the players.  You can now gain access to these areas and may find they make for very comfortable places to stay.  As you are exploring Ash Canyon, be sure to take some time to find the path to the normally inaccessible scenic overlook.  You can safely make your way out to and back from the overlook point and enjoy a breathtaking view of the region.  I suggest waiting for a bright and clear day, because while there is a safe path, there are no guard rails and one wrong step could send you plummenting into The Long Dark!

### • Relocated Cargo Containers & Prepper Caches
Most of the cargo containers have been relocated and will not be found out in the open.  You will need to thoroughly explore Timberwolf Mountain to find them all.  The prepper caches in all three regions have also been relocated to more elusive loactions. 


### • Relocated Wildlife Spawns
Many of the wolf, timberwolf, moose and deer spawn points have been relocated in all three of the regions.  The wolves have not simply been placed to obstruct paths, although there are some that do that.  Similar to a normal playthrough, the wolves can be avoided once you figure out where they all are.  Most of the relocations are meant to encourage playing each of the regions differently from how you usually play them, while offering a bit more of a challenge. 


### • Relocated Player Spawns
Each of the three regions now has one challenging player spawn point.


### • Other Details
Loot has not been altered in anyway, other than some low value items that were added to complete the mod design of the regions.
