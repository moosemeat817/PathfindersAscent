### • Routes
As you move around the regions you will find that many of the routes you are accustomed to using now have impassable points for one reason or another.  There may be a rock blocking the way or an undeployed rope climb that is normally deployed that will prevent you from from continuing on a particular route.  When you are traveling to the major point of interest in these regions (The Summit - The Gold Mine - The Prison), you should expect the journey will be much longer and more difficult than what you are used to.  While the game envirnoment has been altered in many ways, all viable paths forward will be obvious.  In other words, you will not need to search for hidden or very narrow paths to make your way forward.  If it isn't obvious, then there will be subtle hints to point you in the right direction that are in keeping with what you already find in The Long Dark.  There is also no need to employ any advanced techniques or exploits (such as mountain goating) to traverse the more difficult routes.

### • Relocated Cargo Containers & Prepper Caches
Most of the cargo containers have been relocated and will not be found out in the open.  You will need to thoroughly explore Timberwolf Mountain to find them all.  The prepper caches in all three regions have also been relocated to more elusive loactions. 


### • Relocated Wildlife Spawns
Many of the wolf, timberwolf, moose and deer spawn points have been relocated in all three of the regions.  The wolves have not simply been placed to obstruct paths, although there are some that do that.  Similar to a normal playthrough, the wolves can be avoided once you figure out where they all are.  Most of the relocations are meant to encourage playing each of the regions differently from how you usually play them, while offering a bit more of a challenge. 


### • Relocated Player Spawns
Each of the three regions now has one challenging player spawn point.
